# Hailo PCIe driver #

Hailo's PCIe driver is required when working with a Hailo device via the PCIe interface. It links the [**HailoRT library**](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailort)
and the device, and loads the device's firmware when working through this interface. The device driver
is used to manage the Hailo device, communicate with the device and transfer data to/from the device.
