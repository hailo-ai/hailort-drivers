# Hailo PCIe driver #

The Hailo PCIe driver is necessary for interacting with a Hailo device over the PCIe interface. It connects the [**HailoRT library**](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailort) to the device and loads the
device's firmware when using this interface. The driver is responsible for managing the Hailo device, communicating with it, and transferring data to and from the device.
